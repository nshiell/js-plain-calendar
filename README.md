This is a a little JavaScript calendar script.

This can be run in a website just with the .js file and .css file without any other dependancies needed.

to see it in action goto [http://www.nshiell.com/projects/js-plain-calendar/examples/]

To build this yourself please use sass to compile the scss into css.

Have fun!
